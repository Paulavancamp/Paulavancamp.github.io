<h1>&ensp;Tweenie</h1>


<h3> &ensp;What is Tweenie? </h3>
<p>&ensp;Tweenie is a place where teen (and tween!) girls can go to find products for every, shape, size,, skin tone, hair color, and everything that makes them unique. I still have trouble finding pants and shoes that fit, because in other stores, your either small and skinny, or tall and round. And most shoes are made for thin feet. I want Tweenie to revolutionize the world of clothing sizes, and help everybody feel included. The pants sizes will measure both the waist and the height, so instead of size x, it will be size height waist (ex: 40in, 14in)
Another thing I like to focus on is good stuff, for a lower price. I want all of the beauty products to be cruelty free, and made with the best ingredients possible. But that doesn’t mean it has to be expensive! I wish to have cheap makeup, and dollar section for people who don't want to spend a lot of money.

<h3> Ingredients that matter </h3>
<p> Ingredients are a very important part of a product. I’m sure you’ve heard that food companies must put every ingredient they use on the packaging, which is logical. But did you know that no other products have to do that?! Crazy, I know! But you can trust Tweenie, because it will list all of its ingredients, which are all safe and healthy. 

A few bad ingredients (too avoid!):
parabens, artificial fragrance, preservatives,  and silicone.
