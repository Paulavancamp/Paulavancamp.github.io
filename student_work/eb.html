<h3><u id = "title1">Matcha Green Tea</u></h3>
<br>
<p id  = "matcha">Matcha Green Tea is the shade-grown highest-quality green tea that is finely ground into powder. It has a unique farming technique compared to regular green tea plants. That is shading. Green tea plants intended for matcha are shaded from the bright sun for about 3 weeks before harvest. During shading, the matcha green tea plants grow more mentally calming theanine and the naturally green chlorophyll.<img src = "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0332/2957/articles/Kichoen_Bamboo_Tarps_2048x.png?v=1506488794" id  = "greenTea"><br>Once the tea leaves are harvested, the stems and veins are removed and the leaves are steamed. It is hot so it needs to be fanned. Then they go in for their first round of drying and second round in a kiln.<br> <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Single_Shell_Rotary_Drum_Dryer.jpg" id = "greenTea"><br>Then the leaves and stems are seperated and the leaves are finely cut. Then it is ground up into a fine powder known as matcha in a milestone.<img src = "http://theteastylist.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/large-matcha-grinder.jpg" id = "matchaTea"><br>

Place ice water in a large bowl that can hold a pot and set this aside. In a small bowl, add 1/4 cup of milk and green tea powder, and whisk well (the powder may not dissolve completely). Then add this back to the rest of milk (1 3/4 cups) and mix. Heat the milk mixture and 1/2 cup of heavy cream at medium heat, and cook until just before boiling. In a medium bowl, whisk the rest of the heavy cream (1/2 cup), yolks, and sugar. Add hot milk very slowly to the egg mixture and make sure it doesn't curdle. Put egg and milk mixture back to the pot and cook at medium heat stirring constantly until thick (to check the thickness, dip a wood spoon in the egg and milk mixture, and check and see if you can scrape a clear line on the back of the spoon with a finger and if you can it's done). Place the pot in the ice water to cool it. Transfer this to a container and chill for at least 3 hours in the refrigerator. Follow the direction of your ice cream machine and mix. Very soft ice cream is done after about 15-20 minutes. Freeze 3 hours before serving.<img src = "https://www.japanesecooking101.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_0223.jpg" id = "matchaTea"></p>

<h3><u id = "title2">Vanilla Bean</u></h3>

Once the flowers get pollentated, either by hand or bee, the pods start to grow.<br><img src = "https://coorgstories.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pollination82.jpg" id = "vnillaPlnt"><br>The pods are about 3 inches long and bright green. It takes them 9 months until they are fully rip and brown. The beans do not smell like vanilla yet. They used to have the beans dry in the sun and heat them to extremely high temratures, curing them and bringing out the flavour and aroma of vinilian. Now, producers boil them, and dry them for up to 10 weeks on bamboo tables.<br><img src = "https://images.theconversation.com/files/158537/original/image-20170227-26322-dhfiwu.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1000&fit=clip" id = "vanillaBean"><br>After this, they are stored away for up to 3 months for peak flavour and fragrance. It then depends where it is being deported to, people in Eroupe like to eat the raw, extremely odorous bean, while Americans like to put vanilla extract into food. If it is deported to America, then there it is made into extract.<br>
<a href = "https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/homemade-vanilla-ice-cream-3363033">How to make Vanilla Bean Ice Cream</a><br>
In a medium bowl, lightly whisk together the yolks and half of the sugar. In a non-reactive saucepan combine the cream, 1 cup of the milk, the remaining sugar, and the salt. Split the vanilla bean in half, lengthwise, to expose the tar-like seeds inside the pod. Scrape the seeds loose with a knife; add the bean and the seeds to the cream mixture. Heat the cream over medium-high heat until just at a boil. Remove from the heat. Gradually pour the hot liquid into the yolks, while whisking constantly. Return the cream-egg mixture to the saucepan. Cook it over medium-low heat, stirring the mixture constantly, with a wooden spoon in a figure-8 motion, until thickened, about 10 minutes. When the ice cream mixture is properly cooked it should coat the back of a spoon, be satiny thick, and be free of any bubbles on the surface. (If you taste the ice cream base it should have a slight egg-y taste.) When thickened, pour in the reserved milk to prevent the mixture from overcooking. Strain into a medium bowl. Add the cognac if desired. Fill another bowl with ice. Set the bowl of ice cream base in the ice and stir until thoroughly chilled. Freeze the base in an ice cream machine according to the instructions. (Take care not to over churn the ice cream or it will get a grainy texture.) Transfer the ice cream to the freezer to set up for at least 1 hour. Serve and enjoy.<img src = "https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2014/6/27/1/FN_Homemade-Vanilla-Ice-Cream_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.826.620.suffix/1403925376013.jpeg" id = "vanillaBean"></p>
