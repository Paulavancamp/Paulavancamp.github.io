        <h2>Mug Trees</h2>
            <h3>Fall 2018</h3>
              <p> As the days until Christmas grew smaller, I began thinking of what I could make in "bulk" that many people would
                  appreciate as gifts.  An avid tea drinker myself, with lots of mugs cluttering cabinets, I thought making a 
                  mug tree would be fun, decorative, and also encourage me to limit the number of mugs I own.  I ended up making 
                  several for my sister to give as gifts too - some stained and some painted black.  After completing 8, I
                  have refined the rig used to drill holes at an angle and can replicate the process really easily in the future.

    <h2>Adirondack</h2>
        <h3>Summer 2016</h3>
        <p>This outdoor lounger started with my friend Mary, who wanted to try something new.  
            We followed online plans to start us off, but made modifications to make use of scrap wood from 
            my dad's shop.  We started by cutting the sides of the base and carefully sanding their curves to match.
            Then we attached the front legs and bottom panels.  The panes in the back of the chair were assembled 
            to match the spacing in the base. The arms were the the most frustrating pieces of wood I've ever worked with, 
            extremely bowed and splintered, but they were free so we used them to finish the chair.

            <p>This Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired chair was completed for my high school geometry class, with the help of my Dad.
